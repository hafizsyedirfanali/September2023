/// A method can be called by passing a value or a reference.
/// where a reference is an address of a variable or object.
/// the variable that holds the address is called reference variable or reference object.
/// we have three keywords for calling with reference i.e. 'in', 'out', and 'ref'.
/// 1. 'in' keyword specifies that the called function can only read the value from reference. With this passed reference variable must be assigned value before calling.
/// 2. 'out' keyword specifies that the called function must write the value to the reference. With this passed reference variable may or may not be assigned value before calling.
/// 3. 'ref' keyword specifies that the called function can read the value from and write the value to the reference.With this passed reference variable must be assigned value before calling.
